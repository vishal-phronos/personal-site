**Connecting the dots in wellness & illness | Data | Science | Technology**

---

I am motivated by the search for hidden patterns in wellness and illness - and how those patterns change when we intersect with information technologies. My career has traced the extremes, from rare diseases to rarefied luxury. Each domain has offered a different vantage point on the same question: how do we choose the labels by which to define ourselves—especially when the labels themselves are ephemeral?

I trained as an MD and PhD in Genetics at Case Western Reserve University, earned a certificate in Ayurveda from Gujarat Ayurved University, and have spent the past decade building, operating, and deploying data-driven evidence delivery systems across healthcare and wellness.

## Phronos: An Observatory for Human Cognition
**2025 – Present**

I am now building [Phronos](https://phronos.org)—an observatory for human cognition in the era of artificial intelligence. The work involves large-scale analysis of human-AI interactions, cognitive phenotyping, and open-source instrumentation. The premise: to offer tools to fortify ourselves cognitively, so that we engage with AI consciously.

The name comes from *phronesis*—practical wisdom, the kind that cannot be taught but must be cultivated through observation and reflection. Phronos is both a think tank and a cognitive clinic in one: we build instruments that observe cognition in action, measuring how you actually reason, not just what you report believing.

### Dispatches from the Observatory

**DSP-001: Our Extreme Thoughts** examined the largest public dataset of human-AI conversations to date—4.8 million interactions from the WildChat corpus. I expected to find generalizable patterns of communication. Instead, I found a power law: a small group of users—one-tenth of one percent—generated more than a third of all toxic conversations. The paradox of this finding is worth stating: it was only by characterizing the extreme behavior of a small group of individuals that the behavior of the majority could reveal itself. This is the loopiness of epidemiological analysis—the same loopiness found in healthcare, where the extreme behavior of a few eclipses the tendencies of the many.

**DSP-002: What Predicts Who Stays?** asked a seemingly simple question about engagement. What I found was a series of paradoxes that forced me to reconsider what "engagement" with AI actually means. Identity markers—the pronouns "I" and "me," the politeness signals, the self-referential language that psychology literature suggested should matter—contributed almost nothing to prediction. What mattered was how much someone typed, and what topics they explored. Curiosity, measured as semantic diversity across conversations, emerged as the engine of sustained engagement. Duration follows curiosity. Power users are not those with the longest sessions but those with the widest-ranging questions.

**The Frictionless Mind** examined the cognitive risks of generative AI through the lens of semantic networks. The danger is not that AI replaces our intelligence, but that its immediacy confines us to the reactive firing of our current semantic networks, preventing the slow, deliberate friction required to wire new ones. If our semantic associations underlie our expertise, then perhaps by probing them—even challenging them—we can develop a measure of cognitive fitness.

## Sensei: The Science of Wellbeing
**2020 – 2025**

At Sensei, founded by Larry Ellison and Dr. David Agus, I led efforts to transform personal health and wellness information into inspiring experiences to support sustainable lifestyle change. Over five years, I rose from Director of Wellness Research to Co-President and Chief Medical Officer, and, finally, to Chief Science and Innovation Officer, overseeing the scientific integrity of Sensei's evidence-based, data-driven wellness programs.

I was tasked with building the brand's Knowledge Base: creating, evaluating, and disseminating evidence-led content and programming. With a team of researchers, scientists, and wellness experts, we delivered programs that were personally transformative, using the objective lens of data as a means of examining and organizing our subjective experience of wellness.

> "Evidence and data are the lingua franca of successful people globally. Science speaks volumes."

The Sensei Way was built on three paths—Move, Nourish, Rest—and the constant conversation between mind and body that underlies each. We wanted to promote preventative care, healthy lifestyle practices, and new habits for guests to take home. I led our efforts to develop and operationalize the evidence-based narrative for these paths.

As co-President, I oversaw both Sensei retreats—Sensei Lanai, A Four Seasons Resort in Hawaii, and Sensei Porcupine Creek in Rancho Mirage, California, with a primary focus on the wellness and technology side of the brand: retreat programming, scientific affairs, IT, and software engineering.

## Healthcare Analytics & Data Science
**2015 – 2020**

Before Sensei, I worked at the intersection of healthcare, machine learning, and clinical operations—building analytic approaches that reduce medical costs and improve quality. My focus was on the epistemic opacity of the healthcare system: how do we understand and process medical data when the systems generating that data are themselves opaque?

**Syndromic** (2020–2023): I founded Syndromic to organize the exploding volume and variety of wellness information. The paradox of our information age is that while information is becoming more readily available, the answers we seek often become more elusive. Syndromic served as a platform to pursue and publish my efforts to organize this complexity.

**Cogitativo** (2019–2020): As Managing Director at this Berkeley-based, mission-driven data science company, I led a matrixed team of data scientists, engineers, and clinical coders to provide machine learning services that help healthcare organizations reduce their levels of epistemic opacity. We focused on improving payment accuracy, reducing low-value care, and detecting anomalous provider behaviors for payers covering more than 45 million health plan members.

**Pieces Technologies** (2016–2019): As Director of Product (Data Science), I led cross-functional teams to design the next generation of data science products. My responsibilities included NLP and predictive model development, chart abstraction and annotation workflows, and designing data science pipelines to automate manual clinical tasks.

**xG Health Solutions** (2015–2016): As Healthcare Analytics Manager, I developed predictive models of insurance claims and clinical datasets, implemented machine learning algorithms to identify core drivers of clinical outcomes, and served as physician advisor to product development teams.

## Academic Research: Network Signatures of Disease
**2005 – 2015**

My academic training established the methodological foundations I continue to apply: the search for hidden patterns in complex biological and behavioral systems. It was also during this time that I began writing publicly about the tensions I observed in medicine—between population-level statistics and individual care, between treating symptoms and addressing root causes. I kept a blog, [Medicine: A Tough Pill to Swallow](https://toughpill.wordpress.com/), where I questioned the reductionism underlying medical training and wondered whether what we called "personalized medicine" was really just stratified medicine—the interminable substratification of people into ever-smaller categories.

**PhD Research — Network Signatures of Survival in Glioblastoma Multiforme**: My doctoral work at Case Western Reserve University employed combinatorial network analysis to identify molecular patterns distinguishing short-term from long-term survivors of glioblastoma. We achieved 80% prediction accuracy using a 50-gene subnetwork signature, and demonstrated that network-based mRNA signatures serve as better indicators of protein-level dysregulation than sets of differentially expressed single genes—a nearly 7-fold improvement in the rate of discovery. The work was published in *PLOS Computational Biology* (2013).

**Clinical Informatics Research**: As a Research Fellow at MetroHealth System and the Louis B. Stokes VA Medical Center, I utilized the Explorys platform to analyze population-level electronic health records, developing statistical approaches to mine patterns of diagnoses, laboratory data, and medications. I applied natural language processing algorithms to analyze physicians' notes and collaborated with clinicians to identify clinical endpoints to guide data analysis.

**Teaching**: As faculty in the Systems Biology and Bioinformatics program at Case Western Reserve University, I piloted and taught graduate courses in Clinical Research Informatics and an undergraduate course in Healthcare Data Analytics in R.

## The Thread

Looking back, the through-line becomes clear. In glioblastoma, I searched for molecular patterns that could distinguish survivors from non-survivors—and found that the key was not individual gene expression but the configuration of genes in networks. At Sensei, I sought to transform wellness information into actionable insight—and found that the key was not more data but better conversations. Now, at Phronos, I'm asking what happens to human cognition when we intersect with AI systems designed to minimize cognitive friction.

The questions have remained consistent, even as the domains have shifted: How do we choose the labels by which to define ourselves? What patterns are we missing when we average across populations? What gets lost when we optimize for efficiency?

There is something recursive in all of this. I have spent my education and career studying networks—molecular networks, clinical networks, and human networks—and I have come to see my own trajectory as a kind of embedding: the same questions, encoded at different scales and iteratively traversed. My belief continues to be that mapping those trajectories will reveal new insights, which motivates me to keep searching.
